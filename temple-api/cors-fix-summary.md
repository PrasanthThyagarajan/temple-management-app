# CORS Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
Admin user was being redirected to login when accessing menu links in the UI due to missing CORS credentials configuration.

## Root Cause
The CORS policy in `Program.cs` was missing `.AllowCredentials()`, which is required for Basic Authentication headers to be properly sent in cross-origin requests.

## Fix Applied
Updated the CORS configuration in `temple-api/Program.cs`:

```csharp
// Before
policy.WithOrigins(...)
      .AllowAnyHeader()
      .AllowAnyMethod();

// After  
policy.WithOrigins(...)
      .AllowAnyHeader()
      .AllowAnyMethod()
      .AllowCredentials();  // Added this line
```

## Steps to Apply the Fix

1. **Stop the API server** (if running)
   - Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running `dotnet run`
   - Or use Task Manager to end any dotnet.exe processes

2. **Restart the API server**
   ```bash
   cd temple-api
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Access the Frontend**
   - The frontend is running on port 5174 (not 5173)
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:5174

4. **Login as Admin**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`

5. **Menu Access Should Now Work**
   - After login, you should be able to access all menu links
   - The authentication state will persist across navigation

## Why This Happened
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requires explicit permission to send credentials
- Without `.AllowCredentials()`, the browser was not sending the Authorization header
- This caused the API to return 401, which triggered the automatic logout in the frontend

## Additional Notes
- The frontend is configured to automatically logout on any 401 response
- The authentication state is stored in localStorage
- The permissions are checked both client-side and server-side for security
