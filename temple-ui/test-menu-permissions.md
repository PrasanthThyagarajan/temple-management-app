# Testing Menu Permissions

## What was implemented:

1. **Added `hasPageReadPermission` function** in `main.js` that:
   - Checks if a user has read permission for a specific page URL
   - Caches permissions for better performance
   - Always allows Admin role access

2. **Updated `App.vue` to use permission-based visibility**:
   - Each menu item now checks `isMenuVisible(pageUrl)` 
   - Sub-menus only show if at least one child item is visible
   - Menu permissions are loaded when user logs in or authentication changes

3. **Permission flow**:
   - When user logs in, their role permissions are fetched from `/api/admin/role-permissions`
   - Each menu item checks if the user's role has Read permission for that page URL
   - Menu items without Read permission are hidden

## How to test:

1. **As Admin user**:
   - Login with admin credentials
   - All menu items should be visible (Admin has all permissions)

2. **As testuser (General role)**:
   - Login with: `testuser@example.com` / `password123`
   - Should see only these menu items based on General role permissions:
     - Home
     - Dashboard
     - Events submenu (with allowed items)
     - Management submenu (Devotees, Donations)
     - Shop submenu (Products, Sales)
   - Should NOT see:
     - Categories (Admin only)
     - Administration submenu (Admin only)
     - Vouchers (requires ExpenseApproval permission)

3. **Check browser console**:
   - Look for permission check logs
   - Verify permissions are cached after first load

## Key changes:

- Menu items now respect actual database permissions
- No hardcoded role checks for individual menu items
- Permission checks are centralized and cached
- Menu automatically updates when user logs in/out
